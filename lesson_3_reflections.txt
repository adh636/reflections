When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It is a good backup location.
It allows for collabaration and sharing code between systems.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you can decide whether or not updates on github should be pulled to your local environment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are a copy of a github repository into another github repository.
Clones are copies of a repository from github to a local computer, or from local to local.
Branches are commits that diverge from the master branch.

Forks are used when copying from github to github.
Clones are used when copying to something besides github.
Branches are used to edit code without changing the master branch.
